<b>GiX</b> is a decentralised exchange built with Ethereum Smart contracts and ReactJS for ERC-20 token (POI token) trading. Integrated with open order books and price charts for familiar trading engagement and experience with traditional traders. The GiX contract uses Openzeppelin proxies to allow upgradeablility over time. Currently runs on the KOVAN Ethereum test network and has a trading fee of 1%.

`IMPORTANT`
To run GiX locally via npm, you must install a custom kaktana lightweight chart package from https://github.com/mj221/kaktana-react-lightweight-charts. This is a forked version of kaktana that enables overwriting of some default configurations. This is essential to power the price chart in GiX. Either contact me to request a package access or import it as your own package to the local project folder.

#### `Add more token support []`
#### `Introduce tradiing fee tiers with native GiX token []`

<!-- ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
